# Petrol Pump Management System

A Java-based desktop application that manages core operations of a petrol station, including fuel transactions, worker task tracking, car wash bookings, and tuck shop billing. Designed using Java Swing for the GUI and MySQL for backend storage, the system applies key OOP principles and real-time database connectivity to simulate real-world workflows.
